# Example C Library Usage

This repository demonstrates how to build a simple C library and use it in a
main program.

## Building

Run `make` to build the static library (`libmylib.a`) and the `main`
executable:

```sh
make
```

Execute the program with:

```sh
./main
```

Use `make clean` to remove generated files.
